# Vidly Application (Node.js)

## About Project
Build the backend services for Vidly application. Vidly is an imaginary service for renting out movies. Features such as managing the list of genres, each movie has a genre, like action, horror, whatever. We should have an endpoint for getting the list of all genres, becauser somewhere in our client applications, perhaps we have a dropdown list for the user to select a genre. So we need an endpoint to get all the genres, we should also be able to ct=reate a new genre, as well as update, or delete an existing one.
